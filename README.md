The IIIF standard defines two APIs which allow access to digital 
images and metadata. IIIF defines a protocol to allow interoperability 
between digital repositories. The National Library of Wales (NLW) 
has implemented both the Presentation API (metadata) and Image 
API (digital images) that have allowed us to collaborate in a number of 
projects that would have otherwise been more difficult or not possible 
without this public API.
  •	International Image Interoperability Framework.
  •	Exposure and access to digital images and metadata.
  •	Interoperability between digital repositories.
  •	Plug-and-play software.
  •	Promotes reusability
